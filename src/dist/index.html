              KTracker is a bug tracking application I developed to help with a
              program called Kraken that we used in the warehouse at my previous
              job. It is a simple bug and feature request tracker that allows
              for multiple users and storing and exporting reports from the DB.

              I used ReactJS for the front end, Node/ExpressJS for the back end,

              KTracker was the first back-end I built and I learned a ton from
              it. I built a basic CRUD API with Express, dabbled in SQL for the
              database for the first time, and implemented user credential
              validation.
